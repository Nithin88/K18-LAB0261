## Instance Preparation

**NOTE:** If you're following this lab in a ServiceNow-run session, on an instance provided to you for the lab, no preparation steps are necessary. The below steps have already been performed for you.

This lab requires that your instance is running the **Kingston** release of ServiceNow.

1. Activate the **Project Portfolio Suite with Financials** plugin **without demo data**.
2. Download and install the [global update set](resources/update-sets/01-idea-portal-global-update-set.xml).
3. Download and install the [scoped update set](resources/update-sets/02-idea-portal-scoped-update-set.xml), or fork and import the [application in GitHub](https://github.com/sush-chandrashekar/idea-portal-envelope).

For instructions on installing update sets, see the [ServiceNow Documentation site](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-application-development/page/build/system-update-sets/task/t_LoadCustomizationsFromAnXMLFile.html).

That's it! You're now all set to begin the lab!
